# local_load.js
Stop.  You don't want to use this code unless you have odd requirements.  Use this code to load a static file as a string using JavaScript for your completely offline (no web server) html5 project.  Re-evaluate your project first as this is a last resort.  You should use a web server for html5 projects.
